# Sum over a tree

Each node in a tree (mindmap) can hold a number which either is its own value or the sum of its children's values.

## Motivation

* Estimating a feature is too hard when the feature is too big or too generic. So you need to split it into smaller tasks, but then you're likely to miss a point or have to calculate the sum of the descendants on your own.
* Draft planning of larger projects: to get a rough estimation of its parts.
